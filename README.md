### My Own Version of a Pac-Man-Type Game

#### I've decide to build a simple Pac-Man tribute game using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. My goal for this project to replicate a semi-interesting/entertaining game that can be played in the browser without using any of the code from the game we built in school. My entire goal is to learn even more about using the Canvas element, and to broaden my coding horizons with JS.

#### Some element's I would like this project to have:

#### - a maze that restricts player and enemy movements
#### - keyboard control for player: check
#### - wins/deaths counter
#### - Adding images (as opposed to the initial rectangles) for heroes and enemies
